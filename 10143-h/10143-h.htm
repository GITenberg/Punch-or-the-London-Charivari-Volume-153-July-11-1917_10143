  <h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

  <p>"It is more dangerous to be a baby in London than a soldier in France,"
  said Mrs. H. B. IRVING at the National Baby Week Exhibition. The same
  disability&mdash;namely, middle-age&mdash;has prevented us from taking up
  either of these perilous <i>rôles</i>.</p>
  <hr class="short" />

  <p>L.C.C. tram-tickets, says a news item, are now thinner. Other means of
  increasing the space available for passengers are also under
  consideration.</p>
  <hr class="short" />

  <p>Over one thousand penny dreadfuls were found in the possession of a boy
  of sixteen who was sentenced to three months' imprisonment for theft. The
  commonplace nature of the sentence has disgusted the lad.</p>
  <hr class="short" />

  <p>The report that Mr. CHARLES CHAPLIN had signed a contract to serve in
  the British Army at 1s. 1d. a day is denied.</p>
  <hr class="short" />

  <p>As an outcome of Baby Week the Anti-Comforter League has been formed.
  The suggestion that Mr. HOGGE, M.P., would make an admirable first
  President has not been followed up.</p>
  <hr class="short" />

  <p>Humanitarians who have been urging the Government not to stain its hands
  with the more painful forms of reprisal, have received a nasty shock. A
  German spy has been arrested in London!</p>
  <hr class="short" />

  <p>The rubber cushions of billiard tables are now being taken by the German
  military authorities. Meanwhile the enemy Press continues to take its cue
  from HINDENBURG.</p>
  <hr class="short" />

  <p>A notorious Petrograd anarchist is reported to be ill, and has been
  ordered to take a complete rest by his doctor. He has therefore decided not
  to throw any bombs for awhile at least.</p>
  <hr class="short" />

  <p>Further evidence of the Eastern talent for adopting Western ideas and
  improving on them comes from China, where the EX-EMPEROR HSUAN TUNG has
  celebrated Baby Week by issuing a decree announcing his return to the
  Throne.</p>
  <hr class="short" />

  <p>"The only plumber, electrician, hot-water-fitter, gas-fitter,
  bell-hanger, zinc-worker, blacksmith and locksmith we have left"&mdash;such
  was an employer's description of a C1 workman. We understand that the War
  Office will mobilise him as a special corps as soon as they can think of a
  sufficiently comprehensive title for him.</p>
  <hr class="short" />

  <p>Several milkmen have reduced their prices from sixpence to fivepence.
  Other good results from the timely rains are expected.</p>
  <hr class="short" />

  <p>A miner, fined one pound for wasting bread, was said to have thrown his
  dinner&mdash;a mutton chop, onion sauce, and two slices of bread&mdash;on
  the fire because he could not have potatoes. There is a strong feeling that
  the Censor should prohibit publication of these glaring cases of hardship
  on the ground that they are likely to encourage the Germans to prolong the
  War.</p>
  <hr class="short" />

  <p>Large quantities of food have been carried off by a burglar from several
  houses in the Heathfield district. Knowing our War bread, we are confident
  that it did not give in without a struggle.</p>
  <hr class="short" />

  <p>We are sorry to find <i>The Globe</i> making playful reference to the
  many postponements of certain music-hall revues. Mr. Justice DARLING will
  agree that these things cannot be postponed too often.</p>
  <hr class="short" />

  <p>"How can I distinguish poisonous from edible fungi?" asks a correspondent
  of T<i>he Daily Mail</i>. The most satisfactory test is to look for them.
  If you find them they are likely to be poisonous. If they have been already
  gathered they were probably edible.</p>
  <hr class="short" />

  <p>It is now admitted that the conscientious objectors undergoing sentence
  at Dartmoor are allowed to have week-ends occasionally. This concession, it
  appears, had to be granted as several of them threatened to leave the
  place.</p>
  <hr class="short" />

  <p>The pessimists who maintain that this will be a long war are feeling
  pretty cheap just now. An American scientific journal declares that the
  world can only last another fifteen million years.</p>
  <hr class="short" />

  <p>Roughly speaking, says a weekly paper, there is a policeman for every
  sixteen square miles. This gives them plenty of room to turn round in.</p>
  <hr class="short" />

  <p>It is reported that ex-KING CONSTANTINO is to receive £20,000 a year
  unemployment benefit.</p>
  <hr class="short" />

  <p>We have heard so little of the Hidden Hand this past week or so that we
  are tempted to ask whether it is suffering from writer's cramp.</p>
  <hr class="short" />

  <p>It is reported that three large jam factories have been commandeered by
  the Military. A soldier writes to ask whether it is proposed to include jam
  in the list of field punishments.</p>
  <hr class="short" />

  <p>"Justices cannot guarantee results to litigants in advance," said the
  Willesden magistrate recently. Not without trespassing on the privileges of
  the Bar.</p>
  <hr class="short" />

  <p>As a demonstration of allegiance to their country's cause the Apaches of
  Northern America are to hold a great "Devil Dance" in Arizona. It only
  needed this to convince us that all was well with America.</p>
  <hr class="short" />

  <p>A flask of wine of the year A.D. 17, found in a Roman tomb in Bavaria,
  is said to be the oldest extant vintage. It antedates Sir FREDERICK
  BANBURY'S brand of Toryism by several years.</p>

  <h2>MONSIEUR JOSEPH.</h2>

  <p>On the day that I left hospital, with a month's sick leave in hand, I
  went to dine at my favourite Soho restaurant, the Mazarin, which I always
  liked because it provided an excellent meal for an extremely modest sum.
  But this evening my steps turned towards the old place because I wanted a
  word with Monsieur Joseph, the head-waiter.</p>

  <p>I found him the same genial soul as ever, though a shade stouter perhaps
  and greyer at the temples, and I flatter myself that it was with a smile of
  genuine pleasure that he led me to my old table in a corner of the
  room.</p>

  <p>When the crowd of diners had thinned he came to me for a chat.</p>

  <p>"It is indeed a pleasure to see M'sieur after so long a time," said he,
  "for, alas, there are so many others of our old clients who will not ever
  return."</p>

  <p>I told him that I too was glad to be sitting in the comparative quiet of
  the Mazarin, and asked him how he fared.</p>

  <p>Joseph smiled. "I 'ave a surprise for M'sieur," he said&mdash;"yes, a
  great surprise. There are ten, fifteen years that I work in thees place,
  and in four more weeks <i>le patron</i> will retire and I become the
  proprietor. Oh, it is bee-utiful," he continued, clasping his hands
  rapturously, "to think that in so leetle time I, who came to London a poor
  waiter, shall be <i>patron</i> of one of its finest restaurants."</p>

  <p>I offered him my warmest congratulations. If ever a man deserved success
  it was he, and it was good to see the look of pleasure on his face as I
  told him so.</p>

  <p>"And now," said I presently, "I also have a surprise for you,
  Joseph."</p>

  <p>He laughed. "Eh bien, M'sieur, it is your turn to take my breath
  away."</p>

  <p>"My last billet in France, before being wounded," I told him, "was in a
  Picardy village called Fléchinelle."</p>

  <p>He raised his hands. "Mon Dieu," he cried, "it is my own village!"</p>

  <p>"More than that," I continued, "for nearly six weeks I lodged just
  behind the church, in a whitewashed cottage with a stock of oranges, pipes
  and boot-laces for sale in the window."</p>

  <p>"It is my mother's shop!" he exclaimed breathlessly.</p>

  <p>I nodded my head, and then proceeded to give him the hundred-and-one
  messages that I had received from the little old lady as soon as she
  discovered that I knew her son.</p>

  <p>"It is so long since I 'ave seen 'er," said Monsieur Joseph, blowing his
  nose violently. "So 'ard I work in London these ten, fifteen years that
  only once have I gone 'ome since my father died."</p>

  <p>Then I told him how bent and old his mother was, and how lonesome she
  had seemed all by herself in the cottage, and as I spoke of the shop which
  she still kept going in her front-room the tears fairly rained down his
  face.</p>

  <p>"But, M'sieur," said he, "that which you tell me is indeed strange; for
  those letters which she writes to me week by week are always gay, and it
  'as seemed to me that my mother was well content."</p>

  <p>Then he struck his fist on the table. "I 'ave it," he said. "She shall
  come to live 'ere with me in Londres. All that she desires shall be 'ers,
  for am I not a rich man?"</p>

  <p>I shook my head. "She would never leave her village now," I told him.
  "And I know well that she desires nothing in the world except to see you
  again."</p>

  <p>Then as I rose to go, "Good night, M'sieur," said Joseph a little sadly.
  "Be very sure that there is always a welcome for you 'ere."</p>

  <p>The next time that I dined at the Mazarin was some four weeks later, on
  the eve of my return to the Front. A strange waiter showed me to my place,
  and Joseph was nowhere to be seen. Indeed a wholly different air seemed to
  pervade the place since my last visit. Presently I beckoned to a waiter
  whom I recognised as having served under the old <i>régime</i>. "Where is
  Monsieur Joseph?" I asked him.</p>

  <p>"Where indeed, Sir!" the man replied. "It is all so strange. One day it
  is arranged that he shall take over the restaurant and its staff, and on
  the next he come to say 'Good-bye' to us all, and then leave for France.
  Oh, it is <i>drôle</i>. So good a business man to lose the chance that
  comes once only in a life! He is too old to fight. Yet who knows? Maybe he
  heard of something better out there...."</p>

  <p>As the man spoke the gold-and-white walls of the restaurant faded, the
  clatter of plates and dishes died away, and I was back again in a tiny
  village shop in Picardy. Across the counter, packed with its curious stock,
  I saw Monsieur Joseph, with shirt-sleeves rolled up, gravely handing a
  stick of chocolate to a child, and taking its sou in return. In the
  diminutive kitchen behind sat a little white-haired old lady with such a
  look of content on her face as I have rarely seen.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly I found myself back again in the London restaurant.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I said to the waiter, "it is possible, as you say, that Monsieur
  Joseph heard of something better in France."</p>

  <p>And raising my glass I drank a silent toast.</p>

  <h2>THE MUD LARKS.</h2>

  <p>You have all seen it in the latest V.C. list&mdash;"The Reverend Paul
  Grayne, Chaplain to the Forces, for conspicuous bravery and gallant example
  in the face of desperate circumstances."</p>

  <p>You have all pictured him, the beau-ideal of muscular Christian, the
  Fighting Parson, eighteen hands high, terrific in wind and limb, with a
  golden mane and a Greek profile; a Pekinese in the drawing-room, a bull-dog
  in the arena; a soupçon of Saint FRANCIS with a dash of JOHN L.
  SULLIVAN&mdash;and all that.</p>

  <p>But we who have met heroes know that they are very seldom of the type
  which achieves the immortality of the picture post-card.</p>

  <p>The stalwart with pearly teeth, lilac eyes and curly lashes is C3 at
  Lloyd's (Sir FRANCIS), and may be heard twice daily at the Frivolity
  singing, "My Goo-goo Girl from Honolulu" to entranced flappers; while the
  lad who has Fritzie D. Hun backed on the ropes, clinching for time, is
  usually gifted with bow legs, freckles, a dented proboscis and a coiffure
  after the manner of a wire-haired terrier.</p>

  <p>The Reverend Paul Grayne, V.C., sometime curate of Thorpington Parva, in
  the county of Hampshire, was no exception to this rule. Æsthetically he was
  a blot on the landscape; among all the heroes I have met I never saw
  anything less heroically moulded.</p>

  <p>He stood about five feet nought and tipped the beam at seven stone
  nothing. He had a mild chinless face and his long beaky nose, round large
  spectacles, and trick of cocking his head sideways when conversing, gave
  him the appearance of an intelligent little dicky-bird.</p>

  <p>I remember very well the occasion of our first meeting. I was in my
  troop lines one afternoon, blackguarding a farrier, when a loud nicker
  sounded on the road and a black cob, bearing a feebly protesting padre upon
  his fat back, trotted through the gate, up to the lines and began to swop
  How d'y'do's with my hairies. The little Padre cocked his head on one side
  and oozed apologies from every pore.</p>

  <p>He hadn't meant to intrude, he twittered; Peter had brought him; it was
  Peter's fault; Peter was very eccentric.</p>

  <p>Peter, I gathered, was the fat cob, who by this time had butted into the
  lines and was tearing at a hay net as if he hadn't had a meal for
  years.</p>

  <p>His alleged master looked at me hopeless, helpless. What was he to do?
  "Well, since Peter is evidently stopping to tea with my horses," said I,
  "the only thing you can do is to come to tea with us." So I lifted him down
  and bore him off to the cow-shed inhabited by our mess at the time and
  regaled him on chlorinated Mazawattee, marmalade and dog biscuit. An hour
  later, Peter willing, he left us.</p>

  <p>We saw a lot of the Padre after that. Peter, it appeared, had taken
  quite a fancy to us and frequently brought him round to meals. The Padre
  had no word of say in the matter. He confessed that, when he embarked upon
  Peter in the morning, he had not the vaguest idea where mid-day would find
  him. Nothing but the black cob's fortunate rule of going home to supper
  saved the Padre from being posted as a deserter.</p>

  <p>He had an uneasy feeling that Peter would one day suddenly sicken of the
  war and that he would find himself in Paris or on the Riviera. We had an
  uneasy feeling that Peter would one day develop a curiosity as to the Bosch
  horse rations, and stroll across the line, and we should lose the Padre, a
  thing we could ill afford to do, for by this time <span class=
  "pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg 21]</span> he had taken us
  under his wing spiritually and bodily. On Sundays he would appear in our
  midst dragging a folding harmonium and hold Church Parade, leading the
  hymns in his twittering bird-like voice.</p>

  <p>Then the spinster ladies of his old parish of Thorpington Parva gave him
  a Ford car, and with this he scoured back areas for provisions and threaded
  his tin buggy in and out of columns of dusty infantry and clattering
  ammunition limbers, spectacles gleaming, cap slightly awry, while his
  batman (a wag) perched precariously a-top of a rocking pile of biscuit
  tins, cigarette cases and boxes of tinned fruit, and shouted after the
  fashion of railway porters, "By your leave! Fags for the firin' line. Way
  for the Woodbine Express."</p>

  <p>But if we saw a lot of the Padre it was the Antrims who looked upon him
  as their special property. They were line infantry, of the type which gets
  most of the work and none of the Press notices, a hard-bitten, unregenerate
  crowd, who cared not a whit whether Belgium bled or not, but loved fighting
  for its own sake and put their faith in bayonet and butt. And wherever
  these Antrims went thither went the Padre also, his harmonium and his
  Woodbines. I have a story that, when they were in a certain part of the
  line where the trenches were only thirty yards apart (so close indeed that
  the opposing forces greeted each other by their first names and borrowed
  one another's wiring tools), the Padre dragged the harmonium into the front
  line and held service there, and the Germans over the way joined lustily in
  the hymns. He kept the men of the Antrims going on canteen delicacies and
  their officers in a constant bubble of joy. He swallowed their tall stories
  without a gulp; they pulled one leg and he offered the other; he fell
  headlong into every silly trap they set for him. Also they achieved merit
  in other messes by peddling yarns of his wonderful innocence and his
  incredible absent-mindedness.</p>

  <p>"Came to me yesterday, the Dicky Bird did," one of them would relate;
  "wanted advice about that fat fraud of his, Peter. 'He's got an abrasion on
  the knob of his right-hand front paw,' says he. 'Dicky Bird,' says I, 'that
  is no way to describe the anatomy of a horse after all the teaching I've
  given you.' 'I am so forgetful and horsey terms are so confusing,' he
  moans. 'Oh, I recollect now&mdash;his starboard ankle!' The dear babe!"</p>

  <p>In the course of time the Antrims went into the Push, but on this
  occasion they refused to take the Padre with them, explaining that Pushes
  were noisy affairs with messy accidents happening in even the best
  regulated battalions.</p>

  <p>The Padre was up at midnight to see them go, his spectacles misty. They
  went over the bags at dawn, reached their objective in twenty minutes and
  scratched themselves in. The Padre rejoined them ten minutes later, very
  badly winded, but bringing a case of Woodbines along with him.</p>

  <p>My friend Patrick grabbed him by the leg and dragged him into a
  shell-hole. Nothing but an inherent respect for his cloth restrained
  Patrick from giving the Dicky Bird the spanking of his life. At 8 A.M. the
  Hun countered heavily and hove the Antrims out. Patrick retreated in good
  order, leading the Padre by an ear. The Antrims sat down, licked their
  cuts, puffed some of the Woodbines, then went back and pitchforked the
  Bosch in his tender spots. The Bosch collected fresh help and bobbed up
  again. Business continued brisk all day, and when night fell the Antrims
  were left masters of the position.</p>

  <p>At 1 A.M. they were relieved by the Rutland Rifles, and a dog weary
  battered remnant of the battalion crawled back to camp in a sunken road a
  mile in the rear. One or two found bivouacs left by the Rutlands, but the
  majority dropped where they halted. My friend Patrick found a bivouac,
  wormed into <span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg
  22]</span> it and went to sleep. The next thing he remembers was the roof
  of his abode caving in with the weight of two men struggling violently.
  Patrick extricated himself somehow and rolled out into the grey dawn to
  find the sunken road filled with grey figures, in among the bivouacs and
  shell holes, stabbing at the sleeping Antrims. Here and there men were
  locked together, struggling tooth and claw; the air was vibrant with a
  ghastly pandemonium of grunts and shrieks; the sunken road ran like a
  slaughter-house gutter. There was only one thing to do, and that was to get
  out, so Patrick did so, driving before him what men he could collect.</p>

  <p>A man staggered past him, blowing like a walrus. It was the Padre's
  batman, and he had his master tucked under one arm, in his underclothes,
  kicking feebly.</p>

  <p>Patrick halted his men beyond the hill crest, and there the Colonel
  joined him, trotting on his stockinged feet. Other officers arrived,
  herding men. "They must have rushed the Ruts., Sir," Patrick panted; "must
  be after those guns just behind us." "They'll get 'em too," said the
  Colonel grimly. "We can't stop 'em," said the Senior Captain. "If we
  counter at once we might give the Loamshires time to come up&mdash;they're
  in support, Sir&mdash;but&mdash;but, if they attack us, they'll get those
  guns&mdash;run right over us."</p>

  <p>The Colonel nodded. "Man, I know, I know; but look at 'em"&mdash;he
  pointed to the pathetic remnant of his battalion lying out behind the
  crest&mdash;"they're dropping asleep where they lie&mdash;they're beat to a
  finish&mdash;not another kick left in 'em."</p>

  <p>He sat down and buried his face in his hands. The redoubtable Antrims
  had come to the end.</p>

  <p>Suddenly came a shout from the Senior Captain, "Good Lord, what's that
  fellow after? Who the devil is it?"</p>

  <p>They all turned and saw a tiny figure, clad only in underclothes,
  marching deliberately over the ridge towards the Germans.</p>

  <p>"Who is it?" the Colonel repeated. "Beggin' your pardon, the Reverend,
  Sir," said the Padre's batman as he strode past the group of officers. "'E
  give me the slip, Sir. Gawd knows wot 'e's up to now." He lifted up his
  voice and wailed after his master, "'Ere, you come back this minute, Sir.
  You'll get yourself in trouble again. Do you 'ear me, Sir?" But the Padre
  apparently did not hear him, for he plodded steadily on his way. The batman
  gave a sob of despair and broke into a double.</p>

  <p>The Colonel sprang to his feet, "Hey, stop him, somebody! Those swine'll
  shoot him in a second&mdash;child murder!"</p>

  <p>Two subalterns ran forward, followed by a trio of N.C.O.'s. All along
  the line men lifted their weary heads from the ground and saw the tiny
  figure on the ridge silhouetted against the red east.</p>

  <p>"Oo's that blinkin' fool?"</p>

  <p>"The Padre."</p>

  <p>"Wot's 'e doin' of?"</p>

  <p>"Gawd knows."</p>

  <p>A man rose to his knees, from his knees to his feet, and stumbled
  forward, mumbling, "'E give me a packet of fags when I was broke." "Me
  too," growled another, and followed his chum. "They'll shoot 'im in a
  minute," a voice shouted, suddenly frightened. "'Ere, this ain't war, this
  is blasted baby-killin'."</p>

  <p>In another five seconds the whole line was up and jogging forward at a
  lurching double. "And a little child shall lead them," murmured the Colonel
  happily, as he put his best foot forwards; a miracle had happened, and his
  dear ruffians would go down in glory.</p>

  <p>But as they topped the hill crest came the shrill of a whistle from the
  opposite ridge, and there was half a battalion of the Rutlands back-casting
  for the enemy that had broken through their posts. With wild yells both
  parties charged downwards into the sunken road.</p>

  <p>When the tumult and shouting had died Patrick went in quest of the
  little Padre.</p>

  <p>He discovered him sitting on the wreck of his bivouac of the night; he
  was clasping some small article to his bosom, and the look in his face was
  that of a man who had found his heart's desire.</p>

  <p>Patrick sat himself down on a box of bombs, and looked humbly at the
  Reverend Paul. It is an awful thing for a man suddenly to find he has been
  entertaining a hero unawares.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Dicky Bird, Dicky Bird, why did you do it?" he inquired softly.</p>

  <p>The Padre cocked his head on one side and commenced to ooze apologies
  from every pore.</p>

  <p>"Oh dear&mdash;you know how absurdly absent-minded I am; well, I
  suddenly remembered I had left my teeth behind."</p>

  <h2>THE AS.</h2>

  <p>The French, always so quick to give things names&mdash;and so liberal
  about it that, to the embarrassment and undoing of the unhappy foreigner,
  they sometimes invent fifty names for one thing&mdash;have added so many
  words to the vocabulary since August, 1914, that a glossary, and perhaps
  more than one, has been published to enshrine them. Without the assistance
  of this glossary it is almost impossible to read some of the numerous
  novels of poilu life.</p>

  <p>So far as I am aware the latest creation is the infinitesimal word "as,"
  or rather, it is a case of adaptation. Yesterday "as des carreaux" (to give
  the full form) stood simply for ace of diamonds. To-day all France, with
  that swift assimilation which has ever been one of its many mysteries,
  knows its new meaning and applies it.</p>

  <p>And what is this new "as"? I gather, without having had the advantage of
  cross-examining a French soldier, that an "as" is an obscure hero, one of
  the men, and they are by no means rare, who do wonderful things but do not
  get into the papers or receive medals or any mention in despatches. We all
  know that many of the finest deeds performed in war escape recognition. One
  does not want to suggest that V.C.'s and D.S.O.'s and Military Crosses and
  all the other desirable tokens of valour are conferred wrongly. Nothing of
  the kind. They are nobly deserved. But probably there never was a recipient
  of the V.C. or the D.S.O. or the Military Cross who could not&mdash;and did
  not wish to&mdash;tell his Sovereign, when the coveted honour was being
  pinned to His breast, of some other soldier not less worthy than himself of
  being decorated, whose deed of gallantry was performed under less
  noticeable conditions. The performer of such a deed is an "as" and it is
  his luck to be a not public hero. But why ace of diamonds? That I cannot
  explain.</p>

  <p>The "as" can be found in every branch of the Army, and he is recognised
  as one by his comrades, even although the world at large is ignorant.
  Perhaps we shall find a word for his British correlative, who must be
  numerically very strong too. The letter A alone might do it, signifying
  anonymous. "Voila, un as!" says the French soldier, indicating one of these
  brave modest fellows who chances to be passing. "You see that chap," one of
  our soldiers would say; "he's an A."</p>

  <p>All that I know of the "as" I have gathered from the French satirical
  paper, a child of the War, <i>La Baïonette</i>. This paper comes out every
  week and devotes <span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg
  23]</span> itself, as its forerunner, <i>L'Assiette au Beurre</i>, used to
  do, to one theme at a time, one phase or facet of the struggle, usually in
  the army, but also in civil life, where changes due to the War steadily
  occur. In the number dedicated to the glory of the "as" I find recorded an
  incident of the French Army so moving that I want to tell it here, very
  freely, in English. It was, says the writer, before the attack at Carency,
  and he vouches for the accuracy of his report, for he was himself present.
  In the little village of Camblain-l'Abbé a regiment was assembled, and to
  them spoke their Captain. The scene was the yard of a farm. I know so well
  what it was like. The great manure heap in the middle; the carts under
  cover, with perhaps one or two American reapers and binders among them;
  fowls pecking here and there; a thin predatory dog nosing about; a
  cart-horse peering from his stable and now and then scraping his hoofs; a
  very wide woman at the dwelling-house door; the old farmer in blue linen
  looking on; and there, drawn up, listening to their Captain, row on row of
  blue-coated men, all hard-bitten, weary, all rather cynical, all
  weather-stained and frayed, and all ready to go on for ever.</p>

  <p>This is what the Captain said&mdash;a tall thin man of about thirty,
  speaking calmly and naturally as though he was reading a book. "I have just
  seen the Colonel," he said; "he has been in conference with the Commandant,
  and this is what has been settled. In a day or two it is up to us to
  attack. You know the place and what it all means. At such and such an hour
  we shall begin. Very well. Now this is what will happen. I shall be the
  first to leave the trench and go over the top, and I shall be killed at
  once. So far so good. I have arranged with the two lieutenants for the
  elder of them to take my place. He also will almost certainly be killed.
  Then the younger will lead, and after him the sergeants in turn, according
  to their age, beginning with the oldest who was with me at Saida before the
  War. What will be left by the time you have reached the point I cannot say,
  but you must be prepared for trouble, as there is a lot of ground to cover,
  under fire. But you will take the point and hold it. Fall out."</p>

  <p>That captain was an "as."</p>

    <p>NO KILL-JOY. MR. BONAR LAW.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Monday, July 2nd.&mdash;On the Finance Bill Mr. BONAR LAW exhibited a
  conciliatory disposition; and, indignantly disclaiming the character of a
  kill-joy, made several welcome concessions to the taxpayer. The late
  increase in the tobacco duty is to be halved, so that the modest smoker may
  hope to fill his pipe for a penny less per ounce. This hope, of course, is
  dependent upon the decision of the all-powerful Trust.</p>

  <p>The Entertainments Tax also is to be modified, chiefly in its higher
  regions. Intimately connected with this question is the case of the
  "deadhead," argued with the zeal that is according to knowledge by that
  eminent playwright, Mr. HEMMERDE, who knows all about the free-list and its
  services in "enabling the management to keep the house properly
  dressed"&mdash;this refers, of course, to the front of the
  house&mdash;during the doubtful first weeks of a new play.</p>

  <p>Mr. HOGGE was in his place again. It had been reported that, consequent
  upon a hasty pledge to remain in Liverpool until his candidate was
  returned, he was now doomed for ever to wander an unquiet sprite upon the
  banks of Mersey. But he has wisely determined that Parliament must not
  suffer to please his private whim.</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, July 3rd.</i>&mdash;The House of Lords was crowded to hear
  Lord HARDINGE'S comments upon the Mesopotamia Report. Even those critics in
  the Commons who had declared that a civil servant should not take advantage
  of his position as a peer to make a personal explanation would, I think,
  have had no reason to complain of its character. His object was not to
  defend himself, but to call attention to the splendid services that India
  had rendered to the Empire during the War in other fields than Mesopotamia.
  In his own phrase, "India was bled absolutely white during the first few
  weeks of the War."</p>

  <p>When the report comes up for formal discussion Lord CURZON will
  doubtless have something to say, and will say it in vigorous fashion.
  To-day, with the air and mien of a highly respectable undertaker, he
  contented himself with acknowledging Lord HARDINGE'S contribution and
  deprecated further debate.</p>

  <p>Lord ROBERT CECIL, safely back from his travels, does not appear to have
  kept himself up to date in the interval, for he was ignorant of the refusal
  of the Allies to allow Greece to set up a republic, although Mr. KING, with
  his superior sources of information, knows all about it.</p>

    <p>PARENTAL PRIDE. LORD DERBY.</p>
  </div>

  <p>At the close of Questions a stalwart young man in khaki advanced to the
  Table, and, amid the cheers of the Members and to the obvious delight of
  Lord DERBY, who sat beaming with parental pride in the Peers' Gallery,
  added the signature "STANLEY" to a roll which has rarely been without that
  name since "the Rupert of debate" signed it there close on a hundred years
  ago.</p>

  <p>Excess profits provided the theme for some lively speeches to-day. Major
  HAMILTON did not see why farmers should escape the tax, and instanced the
  case of a potato-grower who had made ten thousand pounds out of a couple of
  hundred acres. Several Members connected with the shipping interest
  protested against the tax. Mr. LEIF-JONES implied that it was more
  disastrous than the U-boats, and Mr. HOUSTON loudly protested at being
  represented as a harpy.</p>

  <p>By these complaints Mr. BONAR LAW was absolutely unmoved, and for very
  good reason. He had himself a few thousands invested in shipping, and, as
  he was getting about fifty per cent., instead of the modest five per cent.
  which he had anticipated, he had come to the conclusion that even under
  present conditions the trade was doing pretty well. After this confession
  of an involuntary profiteer the tax was agreed to. But the farmers, with
  next year's Budget in view, are praying that the conscientious CHANCELLOR
  will not invest his surplus profits in land.</p>

  <p>Wednesday, July 4th.&mdash;We all know the
  ex-poacher-turned-game-keeper. The converse process has taken place in the
  case of Lord PORTSMOUTH, who, when he ceased to be a Minister of the Crown,
  became a bitter critic of successive Administrations. His complaints of our
  blockade policy were frigidly acknowledged by Lord MILNER and hotly
  resented by Lord LANSDOWNE, upon whom Lord PORTSMOUTH'S ruddy beard always
  has a provocative effect. It is all very well to talk of being ruthless to
  neutrals, but if we had adopted the noble lord's policy early in the War
  would the Union Jack and the Stars and Stripes be to-day floating side by
  side all over London?</p>

  <p>Mr. LYNCH'S latest suggestion for the furtherance of his Republican
  propaganda is that the COMMISSIONER OF WORKS should remove from the streets
  all statues of deceased monarchs, and replace them by those of great
  leaders of thought. Sir ALFRED MOND absolutely refused. The worst kings
  sometimes make the best statues, and he is not prepared to sacrifice JAMES
  II. from the Admiralty even to put Mr. LYNCH himself on the vacant
  pedestal.</p>

  <p>"P.R." came up smiling for another round, and, having secured the
  services on this occasion of Mr. ASQUITH as judicious bottle-holder, was
  expected to make a good fight of it. The EX-PREMIER scouted the notion that
  the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg 27]</span>
  new plan of voting would fill the House with freaks and faddists, a class
  from which, he hinted, it is not, even under present conditions, entirely
  immune. But the majority evidently felt that there could not be much amiss
  with a system which had returned such wise and patriotic persons as
  themselves to Parliament, and they outed P. R. by 201 to 169.</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, July 5th</i>.&mdash;It is hardly surprising that the
  Government has decided not to proceed at present with its great scheme of
  nationalizing the liquor-traffic. The announcement that, in order to meet
  the requirements of the harvest-season, the brewers should be allowed to
  increase the output of beer by one-third, brought a swarm of hornets about

  diverted to this pernicious liquid; Mr. DEVLIN and other champions of the

  abating, until the SPEAKER, who rarely fails to find the appropriate
  phrase, remarked upon "This thirst for information," and so dissolved the

  <h3>WAR WORK.</h3>

  <p>War work is what wimmen do when their arnt enuff men. Or men do it too
  sometimes if they are rather old and weak and cant be soldiers, but it is
  mostly wimmen. Some war work you get paid for but some you don't. It just
  depens whether you are rich and do V A D or poor and do munisions and
  things. V A D means something but I forget what. My brother says it means
  Very Active Damsles but you cant beleive him, and anyway no one talks of
  damsles nowydays besept in potry. If you are a V A D you have to do as your
  told just like a soldier but Daddy says they don't do it always, and Mummy
  says its because they all know a better way than the other persons. But
  then they don't cost anything so the hospitle people don't mind much. If
  you do munisions or are a bus conductor you do get paid so you maynt talk
  so much or you would get sent away. If I dident have to go to scool I would
  love to be a bus conducter and go rides for nothing.</p>

  <p>A Hero is a man you agmire teribly much or he can be in a book. It is
  rather dificult to say who is my favrit Hero. There are such a lot of them.
  Some are lord French genrel Maud King Albert and the VCs. When I was litle
  I use to think the man who fed the Lions at the zoo was the most bravest
  man in the wurld but that was ever so long ago before the War. I don't no
  very much about King Albert and the Others so I wont rite about them. I
  will rite about lord French. I agmire him most awfuly. I saw him once. He
  was coming from the camp were my Brother was and he smiled at me quite on
  perpose. But he doesent no me realy and praps that wont show he is a Hero.
  But he is one all the same becos he had only a weeny litle Army at the
  Begining of the war and he helped them to hold tite until more Men came. Or
  the Germans would have wun. He was only sir then now he is a lord.</p>

  <h3>"MRS. POMEROY'S REPUTATION."</h3>

  <p>Candour (subacid virtue) compels me to set down that there was nothing
  very notable or novel about the manipulation, by Messrs. HORACE ANNESLEY
  VACHELL and THOMAS COBB, of the comedy of needless complications entitled
  <i>Mrs. Pomeroy's Reputation</i>. The occasion was chiefly notable for the
  return of Miss VIOLET VANBRUGH to active service and the welcome she was
  given by her splendidly loyal following.</p>

    <h4>LETTICE AND IMPROMPTU DRESSING.</h4>

    <p><i>Lettice</i> MISS LETTICE FAIRFAX.</p>

    <p><i>Georgina</i> MISS VIOLET VANBRUGH.</p>

    <p><i>Vincent Dampier</i> MR. FRANK ESMOND.</p>
  </div>

  <p><i>Sir Granville Pomeroy</i>, childless head of an odious family, has
  designs on, and for, the son of his brother's pretty widow, he suspecting
  her to be no fit and proper person to bring up a young <i>Pomeroy</i>. And
  indeed three short months after her husband's death she played bridge,
  bought a kimono and an expensive carpet, and, it is said, even flirted. Why
  such recklessness? Well, she discovered a stray daughter of her sainted
  husband. The irregular mother died, and of course solid <i>Mrs. Pomeroy</i>
  with the bubble reputation did the handsome thing, and shut her mouth until
  the fatal moment in the Third Act, when it all came out. Whereby and
  wherein she discovered that the philandering <i>Vincent Dampier</i> could
  trust where the solemn <i>Maurice Randall</i> could not. As a side issue
  the blameless baronet had a little goose to wife, who went to
  <i>Dampier's</i> Maidenhead bungalow and fell into the river. Elaborate
  lies to explain quite simple situation to fool anxious to believe the
  worst. Moral: Never lie to save a little goose.</p>

  <p>Miss VIOLET VANBRUGH was patently nervous with her part, a little jerky
  and restless. She needn't have been. Loyalty would have carried her through
  a duller play, to say nothing of her charming looks and her queenly way of
  wearing a beautiful gown. Mr. LOWNE, as the baronet, made effective play
  with a quite impossible part in a quite futile situation, and held the
  reflector up to the best Mayfair Cockney with "<i>Georginar</i> explains."
  He needn't apologise; we know it's true to life! The piece of acting that
  most cheered me was Mr. GRAHAME HERINGTON as the philanderer's
  manservant&mdash;a very tactful and observant performance. Mr. FRANK
  ESMOND, the philanderer, seemed ill at ease (partly art but partly nature,
  I judged, perhaps unjustly). Miss LETTICE FAIRFAX as the little goose was
  what I believe is known as adequate.</p>

  <h2>MY CUTHBERT.</h2>

  <p>For months I had been chasing Cuthbert. I had a store of withering
  phrases burning to be poured over his unmentionable head. Last Tuesday my
  opportunity arrived.</p>

  <p>A stranger was sitting comfortably in a deck-chair watching the vacant
  courts at the tennis club. His keen bronzed face and his obviously athletic
  body, clothed in white flannel, brought back to me the far days when the
  sharp clean crack in the adjoining field told of a loose one which had been
  got away square.</p>

  <p>I looked at him again and thought how glad he must be to get into mufti
  for a few days. I tell you this to show how unprejudiced I was. The only
  other signs of life were the two super-aborigines who inhabit the croquet
  patch and detest all other mankind. I approached one of them warily and
  asked a question. He regarded me with a bilious and suspicious eye.</p>

  <p>"Nothing whatever to do with the Army," he snapped, and a Prussian-blue
  opponent was smacked off into an arid and hoopless waste.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" I exclaimed, "then he's only a rabbit after all."</p>

  <p>The old thing gave me an unfriendly glance and then missed his hoop
  badly. I strolled across and sat down beside the newcomer. He smiled at me
  in a frank and disarming manner.</p>

  <p>"What do you think of our courts?" I said by way of a start.</p>

  <p>"Top-hole," he replied; "I'm looking forward to some jolly games on
  'em."</p>

  <p>His obvious disregard of perspective annoyed me. In our village, tennis
  is now played for hygienic reasons only.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid we can't offer you much of a game," I said. "You see there's
  a war on, and&mdash;but perhaps I can fix up a single for you after tea
  with old Patterby. I believe he was very hot stuff in the seventies."</p>

  <p>"That's very good of you. I expect he'll knock my head off; I'm no use
  at the game yet."</p>

  <p>He spoke as though an endless and blissful period of practice was in
  front of him.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you'll be going back soon?"</p>

  <p>"Back where?"</p>

  <p>"I mean your leave will be up."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm out of a job just now."</p>

  <p>So it was genuine blatant indifference. I looked round for something
  with which to slay him.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," he said thoughtfully, "if I shall ever find my tennis legs
  again."</p>

  <p>"Have you lost them?" I asked sarcastically.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid so&mdash;er&mdash;that is, of course, only one of them
  really."</p>

  <p>"Only one of them?" I repeated vaguely.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Fritzie got it at Jutland; but these new mark gadgets are
  top-hole. I can nearly dance the fox-trot with mine already."</p>

  <p>He stretched out the gadget in question and patted it
  affectionately.</p>

  <p>The ensuing moment I count as the worst one I have ever known. I had
  forgotten the Navy. My only excuse is that nowadays, owing to its urgent
  and unadvertised affairs, we seldom have an opportunity in our village of
  meeting the Senior Service. But I feel convinced that the irascible
  Methuselah on the croquet ground was purposely and maliciously guilty of
  <i>suppressio veri</i>.</p>

  <h2>HEART-TO-HEART TALKS.</h2>

  <h3>(<i>The German CROWN PRINCE and Ex-King CONSTANTINE.</i>)</h3>

  <p><i>Crown Prince</i>. My poor old TINO, you are certainly not looking
  yourself. Have a drink?</p>

  <p><i>Tino.</i> No, thank you. I really don't feel up to it.</p>

  <p><i>C. P.</i> But that's the moment of all others when you ought to take
  one. It's good stuff too&mdash;bubbly wine out of the cellar of one of my
  French châteaux. Come, I'll pour you out a glass.</p>

  <p><i>Tino.</i> Well, if I must I must (<i>drinks</i>). Yes, there's no
  fault to be found with it.</p>

  <p><i>C. P.</i> You're looking better already. Now you can tell me all
  about it.</p>

  <p><i>Tino</i> (<i>bitterly</i>). Oh, there's not much to tell, except that
  I was lured on by the promise of help, and when the crisis came there was
  no help, and so I had to go.</p>

  <p><i>C. P.</i> (<i>humming an air</i>).</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>And so, and so</p>
    <p>He had, he had to go.</p>
  </div>

  <p><i>Tino</i>. I beg your pardon.</p>

  <p><i>C. P.</i> Sorry, old man, but the words fitted into the tune so
  nicely I really couldn't resist trying it. Fire ahead.</p>

  <p><i>Tino</i>. I said, I think, that I was promised help.</p>

  <p><i>C. P.</i> Yes, you said that all right.</p>

  <p><i>Tino</i>. And I added that there was no help when the trouble
  came.</p>

  <p><i>C. P.</i> You said "crisis," not "trouble," but we won't insist on a
  trifle like that. Who was the rascal who broke his promise and refused to
  help you?</p>

  <p><i>Tino</i>. You know well enough that it was your most gracious
  father.</p>

  <p><i>C.P.</i> What! The ALL-HIGHEST! The INMOSTLY BELOVED! The
  BEYOND-ALL-POWERFUL! Was it really he? And you believed him, did you? What
  a cunning old fox it is, to be sure.</p>

  <p><i>Tino</i>. You permit yourself to speak very lightly of the AUGUST
  ONE, who also happens to be your father.</p>

  <p><i>C. P.</i> To tell you the truth, I don't take him as seriously as he
  takes himself. Nobody could.</p>

  <p><i>Tino</i>. After what has happened I certainly shall not again. It's
  entirely owing to him that I've lost my kingdom and that the hateful
  VENIZELOS is back in Athens and that ALEXANDER is seated on my throne. If
  your beloved father had only left me alone I should have worried through
  all right.</p>

  <p><i>C. P.</i> I always tell him he tries to do too much, but he's so
  infatuated with being an Emperor that there's no holding him. You know he's
  absolutely convinced that he and the Almighty are on special terms of
  partnership.</p>

  <p><i>Tino</i>. I've done a bit myself in that line and I know it doesn't
  pay.</p>

  <p><i>C. P.</i> I daresay I shall do it when my time comes.</p>

  <p><i>Tino</i>. If it ever comes.</p>

  <p><i>C. P.</i> If it depended on me alone things would go all right. I'm
  told the people like me, and even the Socialists swear by me.</p>

  <p><i>Tino</i>. How can you believe such nonsense? I tried to act on that
  principle and here I am. And poor Russian NICKIE has had an even worse
  fall&mdash;all through believing he had the people on his side.</p>

  <p><i>C. P.</i> Well, but I <i>know</i> they're all fond of me; but my
  All-Highest One may get knocked out before I get my chance, and may carry
  me down with him.</p>

  <p><i>Tino</i>. Well, we must try to bear up, even if he should go the way
  NICKIE has gone. In the meantime the War doesn't look particularly
  promising, does it?</p>

  <p><i>C. P.</i> It certainly doesn't; and the Americans will be at our
  throats directly. Do you know, I never thought very much of HINDENBURG.</p>

  <p><i>Tino</i>. I suppose you know someone who is younger and could do it
  much better.</p>

  <h3>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</h3>

  <p><i>Marmaduke</i> (HEINEMANN) has this peculiarity, that the title rôle
  is by no means its most important or interesting character. Indeed it might
  with more propriety have been called <i>Marrion</i>, since hers is not only
  the central figure in the plot, but emphatically the one over which Mrs. F.
  A. Steel has expended most care and affection. Moreover the untimely death
  of <i>Marmaduke</i> leaves <i>Marrion</i> to carry on the story for several
  chapters practically single-handed. I am bound to say, however, that at no
  stage did she get much help from her colleagues, all of whom&mdash;the
  gouty old father and his intriguing wife, the faithful servant, even
  debonair <i>Marmaduke</i> himself&mdash;bear a certain air of familiarity.
  But if frequent usage has something lessened their vitality, <i>Marrion</i>
  is a living and credible human being, whether as daughter of a supposed
  valet, adoring from afar the gay young ensign, or as the unacknowledged
  wife of <i>Marmaduke</i> and mother of his child, or later as an army nurse
  amid the horrors of Crimean mismanagement. Later still, when the long arm
  of coincidence (making a greater stretch than I should have expected under
  Mrs. Steel's direction) brought <i>Marrion</i> to the bedside of her parent
  in a hospital tent, and converted her into a Polish princess, I lost a
  little of my whole-hearted belief in her actuality. There are really two
  parts to the tale&mdash;the Scotch courtship, with its intrigues,
  frustrated elopements, <i>et hoc genus omne</i>; and the scenes, very
  graphically written, of active service at Varna and Inkerman. I will not
  pretend that the two parts are specially coherent; but at least Mrs. Steel
  has given us some exceedingly interesting pictures of a period that our
  novelists have, on the whole, unaccountably neglected.</p>
  <hr />

  <p><i>The Experiments of Ganymede Bunn</i> (HUTCHINSON) is like to command
  a wide audience. Its appeal will equally be to the lovers of Irish scenes,
  to those who affect stories about horses and hunting, and to the countless
  myriads who are fond of imagining what they would do with an unexpected
  legacy. It was this last that happened to <i>Ganymede</i>, who was left
  seventeen thousand pounds by an aunt called <i>Juno</i> (the names of this
  family are not the least demand that Miss Dorothea Conyers makes upon your
  credulity). My mention of horses and Ireland shows you what he does with
  his money, and where. It does not, however, indicate the result, which is a
  happy variant upon what is usual in such cases. You know already, I
  imagine, the special qualities to be looked for in a tale by Miss
  Conyers&mdash;chief among them a rather baffling inability to lie a
  straight course. If I may borrow a metaphor from her own favourite theme,
  she is for ever dashing off on some alluring cross-scent. More important,
  fortunately, than this is the enjoyment which she clearly has in writing
  her stories and passes briskly on to the reader. There's a fine tang of the
  open-air about them, and a smell of saddle-leather, that many persons will
  consider well worth all the intricacies of your problem-novelists. I had
  the idea that her honest vulgar little legatee and his speculations as a
  horse-breeder might make a good subject <span class="pagenum"><a name=
  "page32" id="page32"></a>[pg 32]</span> for a character-comedian; but I
  suppose the late LORD GEORGE SANGER is the only man who could have produced
  the right equine cast.</p>
  <hr />

  <p>The component elements of <i>The White Rook</i> (CHAPMAN AND HALL) may
  be summarised in the picturesque argot of Army Ordnance somewhat as
  follows: Chinamen, inscrutable, complete with mysterious drugs, one; wives,
  misunderstood, Mark I, one; husbands, unsympathetic (for purposes of
  assassination only), one; <i>ingénues</i>, Mark II, one; heroes, one;
  squires, brutal, one; murders of sorts, three; ditto, attempted, several.
  The inscrutable one is responsible for all the murders. Only the merest
  accident, it seems, prevents him from disposing of the few fortunate
  characters who survive to the concluding chapters of the story. He narrowly
  misses the misunderstood wife (now a widow, thanks to his kind offices),
  and his failure to bag the hero and <i>ingénue</i> (together with a handful
  of subsidiary characters) is only a matter of minutes. There is almost a
  false note about the last chapter, in which the Oriental commits suicide
  before he has completed his grisly task; but it was obviously impossible
  for anyone in the book to live happily ever after so long as he remained
  alive. Just how Mr. HARRIS BURLAND and the villainous figment of his lively
  imagination perform these deeds of dastard-do is not for me to reveal. The
  publishers modestly claim that in the school of WILKIE COLLINS this author
  has few rivals. As regards complexity of plot the claim is scarcely
  substantiated by the volume before me; but if bloodshed be the food of
  fiction Mr. BURLAND may slay on, secure in his pre-eminence.</p>
  <hr />

  <p>The <i>Rev. Frank Farmer</i>, hero of Mr. RICHARD MARSH'S <i>The
  Deacon's Daughter</i> (LONG), was the youthful, good-looking and eloquent
  Congregationalist minister of the very local town of Brasted, and the
  ladies of his flock adored him. So earnestly indeed did they adore him
  that, after he had preached a stirring series of sermons on the evils of
  gambling, they decided to subscribe and send him for a holiday to Monte
  Carlo. On his return he was to preach another course of sermons, which
  "would rouse the national conscience and, with God's blessing, the
  conscience of all Europe." Possibly you can guess what happened to him; I
  did, and I am not a good guesser. The <i>Rev. Frank</i> had never been out
  of England, and he found Monte Carlo inhabited by ladies who made him
  blush. He could not understand their bold ways, so different from the
  manner of the Brasted maidens. One of them laid especial siege to him and
  assured him that he had "<i>la veine</i>." At first I am inclined to
  believe that he thought she was talking of something varicose, but when he
  understood what she meant he was at her mercy. In short he tried his luck,
  to the dismay of his conscience but with prodigious benefit to his pocket.
  His return to Brasted is described with excellent irony.</p>
  <hr />

  <p>Mr. WILL IRWIN'S war-book naturally divides itself into two parts, since
  he was lucky enough to get near the Front both about Verdun during the
  great attack, and with the Alpini fighting on "the roof of Armageddon." To
  these brave and picturesque friends of ours he dedicates his study, <i>The
  Latin at War</i> (CONSTABLE). You must not expect much of that inside
  information which the author, as an American journalist, must have been
  sorely tempted to produce. Indeed he has little to offer us that has not
  been common property of the Correspondents for long enough, and several of
  his descriptions (his picture of a glacier, for one), given with a rather
  irritatingly childlike air of new discovery, cannot escape the charge of
  commonplace. But his reflections, for once in a way the better half of
  experience, more than make good this defect. His essay on Paris, for
  instance&mdash;"the city of unshed tears"&mdash;is something more than
  interesting, and his analysis of the cause of the successes of the French
  army, in the face of initial defects of material, even better. The author
  of <i>Westward Ho!</i>, considering the Spanish and English navies of
  ELIZABETH'S time, found precisely the same contrasted elements of autocracy
  and brotherliness producing just those results that we find respectively in
  the German and French forces of to-day&mdash;on the one hand a mechanical
  perfection of command, on the other an informed equality which, somehow,
  does not make against efficiency whilst fostering individuality. Mr. IRWIN
  hardly refers to our own Army; but one is thankful to remember that
  discipline by consent, one of the virtues of true democracy, is not the
  exclusive tradition of our French allies.</p>
  <hr />

  <p><i>A London Posy</i> (MILLS AND BOON) is a story with at least an
  original setting. So far as I know, Miss SOPHIE COLE is the first novelist
  to group her characters about an actual London house preserved as a
  memorial to former inhabitants. The house in question is that in Gough
  Square, where Dr. JOHNSON lived, and two of the chief characters are
  <i>George Constant</i>, the curator, and his sister, to whom the shrine is
  the most precious object in life ("housemaid to a ghost," one of the other
  personages rather prettily calls her). It therefore may well be that to
  ardent devotees of the great lexicographer this story of what might have
  happened in his house to-day will make a stronger appeal than was the case
  with me, who (to speak frankly) found it a trifle dull. It might be said,
  though perhaps unkindly, that Miss COLE looks at life through such feminine
  eyes that all her characters, male and female, are types of perfect
  womanhood. In <i>Denis Laurie</i>, the gentle essayist and recluse, one
  might expect to find some feminine attributes; but even the bolder and
  badder lots, whose task it is to supply the melodramatic relief, struck me
  as oddly unvirile. But this is only a personal view. Others, as I say, may
  find this very gentle story of mild loves and two deserted wives a
  refreshing contrast to the truths, so much stranger and more lurid than any
  fiction, by which we are surrounded.</p>

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS," WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
